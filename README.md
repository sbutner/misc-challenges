This is a collection of miscellaneous toy challenges that I've done to work through something in my head.

# Birthday Paradox
A simulation based solution to the [Birthday Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem). Runs the simulation until the margin of error for the output is below a \(hardcoded\) critical value. 

# Numeric Range
Take an iterable, return the difference between the max and min elements. Return 0 for any empty iterable, and work on iterables other than lists.
